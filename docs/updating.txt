Assume you have tested locally, pushed changes to the the project branch and are ready to roll the 
changes out to a remote server.

```
fab deploy
```


If you want to upload a new dataset, update the local_data.py file and run

```
#scp to remote server
ssh <remote server>
source <venv>/bin/activate
cd <src>/priorities
touch ../MAINTENANCE_MODE
# edit local_import.sh
sh local_import.sh
python manage.py clear_cache
rm -rf /tmp/<app>-stache
python manage.py precache
chmod 775 /tmp/<app>-stache
chown mperry:www-data /tmp/<app>-stache
touch ../deploy/wsgi.py
sudo service celeryd_<app> restart
# TEST
touch ../MAINTENANCE_MODE
```

The `fab maintenance_on` and `fab maintenance_off` switches can be used to take down the live site.
