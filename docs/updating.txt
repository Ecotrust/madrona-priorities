Assume you have tested locally, pushed changes to the the project branch and are ready to roll the 
changes out to a remote server.

```
fab deploy
```

If you want to upload a new dataset, update the local_data.py file and run

```
fab import_dataset
ssh <remote server>
# restart celeryd
exit
fab maintenance off # go live
```

The `fab maintenance_on` and `fab maintenance_off` switches can be used to take down the live site.
