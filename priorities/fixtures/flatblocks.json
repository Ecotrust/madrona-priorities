All users are able to view priorities, pan and zoom using the map tool and explore input data sets pertaining to aquatic species as well as inputs into the climate change, watershed condition and aquatic invasives analyses.  Registered users sign in by clicking on the \u201csign in\u201d menu in the upper right hand corner.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Review Regional Aquatic Priorities</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThe map to the right represents regional aquatic priorities identified by USFWS using this decision support tool.  On this map, the darker areas represent those areas that are considered high priority. For additional information on how these priorities were created the detailed <a href=\"/docs.html\">documentation</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClick the \u201cdata and priorities\u201d tab at the top of this page and there you will see the priorities layer at the top of the tree view under the \u201cRegional Priorities\u201d heading. You can click on each sub-basin in the map for additional information specific to the level of importance, sub-basin name and area and prioritization constraints such as vulnerability to climate change, watershed condition and vulnerability to aquatic invasives.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Explore data inputs</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAlso available to explore are data used to generate the priorities including species specific information and watershed factors related to climate change, watershed condition and aquatic invasives.  These data are under the heading \u201cPriorities input data\u201d.  To explore these layers, click on the arrow next to the heading and a tree view will expand exposing the layers.  Click on the check box next to the desired layer and you will see it appear on the map.  Many of these data are imbedded in subsequent sub-folders.  For additional information on any of these data layers, please see the <a href=\"/home/data_dictionary.pdf\">data dictionary</a>.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n",
