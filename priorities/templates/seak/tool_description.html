            <h2>Description of the Regional Aquatic Priorities On-Line Tool</h2>
            <br/>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
            This tool was designed as a web interface to solve the question, "<em>Given a set of constraints, which sub-basins should I focus on to maximize conservation objectives for specified aquatic species.</em>" Typically, solving these problems, compiling the data and analyzing it, is prohibitively complex and too time-consuming for the majority of potential users. We have created a suite of GIS datasets coupled with a back-end decision support model, packaged within this web-based tool to facilitate iterative and collaborative exploration of regional aquatic priorities. 
            </p>
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p> The software was built on many successful and proven technologies including <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/earth/">Google Earth</a>, <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/marxan/">Marxan</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. The source code is open source and is available to view or download at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/watershed-priorities/">the watershed-priorites code site</a>. </p>
            <h3>Tutorial</h3>
            <p>For registered users, a walk-through of all software features has been drafted as part of a <a href="tutorial.html">step-by-step tutorial</a>. </p>
